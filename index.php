            <p>People always ask to pat my dog, Dave.  Unfortunately, I have to say no, because in his 
                harness, he is working.  Still, I hate to deny them the pleasure of patting and romping 
                with such a silly dog, so I suggest they come to our home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where 
                I&rsquo;ll remove his harness and allow patting&mdash;ceaselessly.  Of course, it&rsquo;s 
                impossible for all who want to pat Dave to come to my home, so I invite you into my website 
                instead.  There will be a lot less dog hair to deal with!</p>
