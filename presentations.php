<p>I teach four courses in Chatham University&rsquo;s M.F.A. program, writing autobiography and biography for children and teens (Transcribing Lives), writing fantasy and science fiction (Inventing Wonder), and young adult literature (Blue Jeans Lit). In summer, 2009, I taught a class on disability literature, (The ability within disability,) which was experiential as well as academic. I also lead two critique groups out of my home.  In addition, I give talks to students K-12 and to parents, teachers, librarians, and professionals concerned with </p>

	<ul>
		<li>Disability</li>
		<li>Perseverance</li>
		<li>Starting Over</li>
		<li>Writing</li>
		<li>Children&rsquo;s literature</li>
	</ul>
</div>
        
<div class="content">
    
<p>I also deliver inspirational keynote speeches (&ldquo;If I can do it, you can, too&rdquo;), give staff training, family, and parent seminars, and participate in panel discussions at literature and disability conferences. </p>

<h3>My presentations include:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Perseverance</li>
		<li>Starting Over</li>
		<li>&ldquo;What to Do With a Blank Page&rdquo;: an interactive talk about the elements of writing, such as plot, using student participation, visual aids, and a writing exercise</li>
		<li>&ldquo;PQS: Praise, Questions, and Suggestions &ldquo;The Writer as Rewriter&rdquo;:  a workshop devoted to hands-on techniques that help the writer become her own editor</li>
		<li>&ldquo;Children&rsquo;s Literature: Antidote to the World&rsquo;s Ills&rdquo;: interactive discussion of the ways children&rsquo;s books shore up kids&rsquo; heroes, values, and abilities to resolve conflict</li>
		<li>&ldquo;Do You Remember the Color Blue?&rdquo;:  an interactive talk on blindness and deafness, using audience participation to understand coping strategies and the culture of the disabled</li>
		<li>&ldquo;Breaking Down the Barriers&rdquo;: an interactive workshop that helps improve social interaction between the disabled and able-bodied </li>
	</ul>
		
	<p>My motto, like that of Laura Bridgman&rsquo;s teacher, Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe, is &ldquo;obstacles are things to be overcome.&rdquo;</p>
