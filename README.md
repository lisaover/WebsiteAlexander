Website files for children's author Sally Hobart Alexander to promote her books and other publications

This website is optimized for screen reading software using accessible style techniques. In addition, I designed the site for visual appeal, usability, and maintainability using PHP, XHTML, and CSS. I initially created the site in December 2011 and continue to update and maintain it.
