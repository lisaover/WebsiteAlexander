<p>Jacket Copy: &ldquo;When Sally Alexander loses Marit, her first guide dog, the entire family mourns.  
    But for Sally, this death means more than heartache; it means reduced mobility.  
    Sally finds walking with another person or with a cane inadequate and decides to return to 
    The Seeing Eye for another dog.  Told by her twelve-year-old daughter, Leslie, who narrated Mom 
    Can&rsquo;t See Me, this is a story of a mother leaving her family to meet, get to know, and bring 
    home a  new and crucial member of the household.  This sequel to Mom Can&rsquo;t See Me sheds light 
    on what it&rsquo;s like to be a blind person and to be parented by one.  The book is also illustrated 
    by George Ancona&rsquo;s photos.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In this sequel to <span class="italic">Mom Can&rsquo;t See Me</span> (Macmillan, 1990), Alexander describes how she obtains and works with a new guide dog. This book is again written from the point of view of her daughter, Leslie, who describes what her mother must go through in training  a new dog after the death of her old one and the minor disasters in the family's life while the  woman is away at school. The book also gives information on what a blind person and guide dog must do in training and the problems they face, such as dealing with low branches and other dogs. Clear, informative and entertaining black-and-white photos illustrate almost every page of the account.&rdquo;</p>
